signal_metrics is the original csv file, collected from kaggle. In data.py it is cleaned and scaled. then in try.py model is trained. then in bandwidth.py we are importing the trained model and predicted the bandwidth based on test data. After everything we set up an data generator which provides 3 features as output, then we are feeding it continuously to advPredictions file where our trained lstm model is loaded and maing bandwidth output.
